## Flask

I chose Flask web framework because it is a widely used minimalistic framework (microframework) with open source, quality support, detailed documentation. An important factor in choosing it is the fact that I have minimal experience with this framework, which will allow me to complete tasks on time, quickly make changes to the code if necessary, due to a better understanding of it.
